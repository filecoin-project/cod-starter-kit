# FEVM Compute Over Data Kit

## Cloning the Repo

Open up your terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to a directory you would like to store this code on. Once there type in the following command:


```
git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/fevm-hardhat-kit.git
cd fevm-hardhat-kit
yarn install
```


This will clone the hardhat kit onto your computer, switch directories into the newly installed kit, and install the dependencies the kit needs to work.


## Get a Private Key

You can get a private key from a wallet provider [such as Metamask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).


## Add your Private Key as an Environment Variable

Add your private key as an environment variable by running this command:

 ```
export PRIVATE_KEY='abcdef'
```

If you use a .env file, don't commit and push any changes to .env files that may contain sensitive information, such as a private key! If this information reaches a public GitHub repository, someone can use it to check if you have any Mainnet funds in that wallet address, and steal them!


## Get the Deployer Address

Run this command:
```
yarn hardhat get-address
```

This will show you the ethereum-style address associated with that private key and the filecoin-style f4 address (also known as t4 address on testnets)! The Ethereum address can now be exclusively used for almost all FEVM tools, including the faucet.


## Fund the Deployer Address

Go to the [Hyperspace testnet faucet](https://hyperspace.yoga/#faucet), and paste in the Ethereum address from the previous step. This will send some hyperspace testnet FIL to the account.


## Deploy the Contracts


Type in the following command in the terminal to deploy the contracts:

 ```
yarn hardhat deploy
```

This will compile all the contracts in the contracts folder and deploy them to the Hyperspace test network automatically!

Keep note of the deployed contract addresses for the next step.

## Interact with the StableDiffusionCallerV2 Contract

You can interact with contracts via hardhat tasks, found in the 'tasks' folder. For example, to interact with the SimpleCoin contract:

Type in the following command in the terminal:

 ```
yarn hardhat stable-diffusion --contract 'THE DEPLOYED CONTRACT ADDRESS HERE' --prompts 'Awesome Decentralized Storage'
```
